    "This notebook demonstrates how to classify detected events using Bayesian model comparison. For the source code, see `model_comparison/comparator.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `mono-cbp`'s detection algorithm does not exclude events based on their morphology, we need a way to determine which events are consistent with a transit morphology. Other events that are typically either artefacts of poor detrending or spacecraft/detector systematics may pass the previous automated vetting tests, but tend to have characteristic morphologies.\n",
